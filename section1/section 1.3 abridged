1.1 buffer overflow is whenever an attacker tries to write more into a memory section than what is allowed. This may cause the excess to overflow into the adjacent memory, which may cause it to crash or other malicious activities
1.2 csrf occurs when an attacker steals the credentials from a user who is already logged in through his browser. By acquiring these credentials, they can send a request masquerading as the user and gain access to data they should not be able to. SSRF are similar, but rather than sending the request throught the client, they send it directly to the server. 
1.3 there are multiple types of injections. An SQL injection is where the attacker enters an sql query into a poorly validated site or app that utilizes sql and is capable of accessing data she isnt supposed to. There are other types of injections, such as XML, LDAP, and others. Injections is basically inputting code in places you arent supposed to be able to run such commands and accessng otherwise inaccesible data
1.4  hackers may use drivers as a way of attacking a system. Drivers are what your system uses in order to have software adn hardware communicate. Since they are trusted, attackers can use these to formulate attacks. Since antiviruses detect malware based on signatures, metamorphic malware (or malware that has the code refactored every time its downloaded) will make it harder for the system to detect the signatrue, since its beign scrambled every timi
1.5 There are a wide variety of application attacks that a hacker may attempt to exploit. Memory manipulation or memory overflow may cause DoS. Traversal attacks are quite dangerous since they may allow attackers to acces otherwise inaccesible areas, which may be sensistigve. API attacks may allow a hacker to access information that they shouldnt have accces to, or they may manipulate the API to do somethign it shouldnt. Resource exhaustion may cause a server to stop accepting new connections or may slow down the services for everyone.
