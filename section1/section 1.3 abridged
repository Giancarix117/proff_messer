1.1 buffer overflow is whenever an attacker tries to write more into a memory section than what is allowed. This may cause the excess to overflow into the adjacent memory, which may cause it to crash or other malicious activities
1.2 csrf occurs when an attacker steals the credentials from a user who is already logged in through his browser. By acquiring these credentials, they can send a request masquerading as the user and gain access to data they should not be able to. SSRF are similar, but rather than sending the request throught the client, they send it directly to the server. 
1.3 there are multiple types of injections. An SQL injection is where the attacker enters an sql query into a poorly validated site or app that utilizes sql and is capable of accessing data she isnt supposed to. There are other types of injections, such as XML, LDAP, and others. Injections is basically inputting code in places you arent supposed to be able to run such commands and accessng otherwise inaccesible data
