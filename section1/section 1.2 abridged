1.1 Adversarial AI involves malicious actors poisoning the machine learning process in hopes of corrupting the data within the learning module. 
1.2 bots are computers that have been infected and taken over by malware. They receive orders from teh command centers , which control big groups of bots know as botnets.
1.3  there are advantages and disadvantages between cloud and physical premisses. on premisses you can handle all the adata and have everything under your control, but its waaay more expensive adn more work. On the cloud its cheaper and its also really secure but the data is not really within your possesion
1.4 cryptographic attacks take place when an attacker attempts to abuse and exploit a cerain encryption algorithm. From hash collisions to downgrade attacks, where the attacker sits in the middle of a conversation between two points and gets them to ue a depracated encryption algorithm.
1.5 logic bombs are pieces of malware that have been coded to set off at a certain time. They are hard to spot so its really hard to stop one of them before activation
1.6 hashing is the use of algorithms to turn text into unreadable giberish to make it harder for attacker sto get passwords. Salting is random bits of data added at the beginning of a password to make it extra hard for attackers to crack
1.7 physical attacks consist of multiple vectors. Some popular ones are malicious usb cables or drives which have aditional hardware which allows them to be recognize as human interphace devices, which allows them to act as keyboards and run commands, which will ultimately allow them to download malware. Another physical attack is credit card skimming, in which attackers replace the entry slot for atms with a malicious device which will copy the magnetic strip and llow them to duplicate the card.
