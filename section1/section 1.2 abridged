1.1 Adversarial AI involves malicious actors poisoning the machine learning process in hopes of corrupting the data within the learning module. 
1.2 bots are computers that have been infected and taken over by malware. They receive orders from teh command centers , which control big groups of bots know as botnets.
1.3  there are advantages and disadvantages between cloud and physical premisses. on premisses you can handle all the adata and have everything under your control, but its waaay more expensive adn more work. On the cloud its cheaper and its also really secure but the data is not really within your possesion
1.4 cryptographic attacks take place when an attacker attempts to abuse and exploit a cerain encryption algorithm. From hash collisions to downgrade attacks, where the attacker sits in the middle of a conversation between two points and gets them to ue a depracated encryption algorithm.
1.5 logic bombs are pieces of malware that have been coded to set off at a certain time. They are hard to spot so its really hard to stop one of them before activation
1.6 hashing is the use of algorithms to turn text into unreadable giberish to make it harder for attacker sto get passwords. Salting is random bits of data added at the beginning of a password to make it extra hard for attackers to crack
1.7 physical attacks consist of multiple vectors. Some popular ones are malicious usb cables or drives which have aditional hardware which allows them to be recognize as human interphace devices, which allows them to act as keyboards and run commands, which will ultimately allow them to download malware. Another physical attack is credit card skimming, in which attackers replace the entry slot for atms with a malicious device which will copy the magnetic strip and llow them to duplicate the card. 
1.8 ransomware is malware that encrypts your system files and demands a payment in order to have it decrypted. 
1.9 rootkits are hella dangerous. They install themselves in the kernel and gain ultimate access to everything and make it incredibly hard to detect and remove them. 
1.10 adware is malware designed specifically to plague your system with avertisements. Spyware spies on you and tries to  find your credentials for important stuff, such as banking info. 
1.11 supply chain attacks occur when the attacker decides to target the vendor rather than the company it wants to hack. They try to gain access throught the vendor. Either by installing malware in the manufactured pieces that will ship out to the company, or by trying to gain access through the vendor itself
1.12 Trojans is malware that is embedded in a potentially good program. Once installed, it is excecuted and will attempt to open  backdoor or to take control of the system. RATs are Remote Access Trojans. Much like regular trojans, they slip undetected into your system and will then attempt to gain control and provide the attacker with remote access to the system.
1.13 Viruses require user interaction to propagate, such as clicking a link, running a program, and such. Worms propagate without user ineratction. THey go from system to system trying to infect as many devices as possible
